	* change: structure for relations parsing has changed
	The structure of the data passed to the relation callback has
	changed. The new API implementation returns a relation object
	like this:

	{
	  "members": [
            {
              "type": "node",
              "ref": "12345678",
              "role": ""
            },
            {
              "type": "way",
              "ref": "87654321",
              "role": ""
            }
          ]
	}

	The change in the osm-read API has been made in order to
	maintain the order of the relation members. See the following
	github issue for more details:
	https://github.com/marook/osm-read/issues/20

	The v0.4.0 release used the following no longer used data
	structure:

        {
          "members": {
            "nodes": [
              {
                "ref": "12345678",
                "role": ""
              }
            ],
            "ways": [
              {
                "ref": "87654321",
                "role": ""
              }
            ]
          }
        }

	If you use relations you have to migrate your code accordingly.
