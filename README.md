# python router
This project consults of two major parts

- Reading and turning map data (such as osm) into routable data (like a graph)
- Routing (todo: with traffic data) on routable data as big as a full city

For use enter cordinates by opening index.html (in a browser)
and click on start and destination spots on the map.
(hold s key down + click mouse, the mouse position will be one of the nodes. First spot chosen will be start and second destination)
 Then simply run router.py in pyrouter directory and wait until the path is displayed on a new tab
