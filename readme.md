# python router
This project as it's name expresses, is a router. Basically finds a path
between two spots on a map.

It's developed with django (so you probably need it, just "pip install django").
For using run manage.py in mysite directory.

python manage.py runserver

Then go to a browser and go to your local ip (e.g. 127.0.0.1:8000).
Next choose a source and destination and start pathfinding.
